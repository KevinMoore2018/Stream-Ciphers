# A5-1
Implementation of the A5/1 Stream Cipher

## Run Configuration
The main runnable file is A51.java, which accepts 3 commandline arguments:
[1] /path/to/file.ext
[2] 64-bit Key (in hexadecimal notation - cannot exceed 16 characters).
For example: FEDCBA9876543210  is okay, but FFFEDCBA9876543210 is too large.
[3] 22-bit Frame Number (in hexadecimal notation).
For example: C45AF  is okay, but C45AFF is too large.

## Expected Output
The program will produce two files. One file be the encrypted file written to
/path/to/file(encrypted).ext and the other will be the decrypted file which is 
written to /path/to/file(encrypted)(decrypted).ext.
